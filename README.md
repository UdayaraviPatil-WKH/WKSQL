Got a quick question? [Discussions](https://github.com/UdayaraviPatil-WKH/WKSQL) here on `GitHub` is the preferred place to ask!

[WKSQL](https://github.com/UdayaraviPatil-WKH/WKSQL) lets you execute TSQL commands on a remote SQL Server and get the results. It is a lightweight .NET wrapper. About 30% of the bindings are written in C# and 70% of code is in T-SQL.

WKSQL is [MIT](https://github.com/UdayaraviPatil-WKH/WKSQL?tab=MIT-1-ov-file) licensed, so it can be used in proprietary applications.

## Releases

Stable binaries are released and deployed, and contain everything you need to embed in your T-SQL stored procedures. For usage see the [Quick Start](https://github.com/UdayaraviPatil-WKH/WKSQL/wiki) guide.

## Branches & Forks

Development is done in the `master` branch. New features are preferably added in feature branches, if the changes are more than trivial. New `PR's` should be targeted against `master`.

When a new release is imminent a `release` branch is created. We try to avoid making public facing `API` changes in `release` branches (Adding new features is fine, just not breaking changes).
